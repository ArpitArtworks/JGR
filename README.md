# JGR - Java GUI for R

This is source for [JGR](http://www.rforge.net/JGR/) project.

:exclamation: it also contains code from [RoSuDa Java package](https://github.com/s-u/rosuda) which is based in module `ibase` to be totally self-contained and have no dependency to iPlots anymore. As well as [JavaGD](http://www.rforge.net/JavaGD/) to be able to compile.
