# JGR - Java GUI for R

This is mainly the source for http://www.rforge.net/JGR/ project.

:exclamation: it also contains code from https://github.com/s-u/rosuda which is based in module `ibase` to be totally self-contained and have no dependency to iPlots anymore. As well as http://www.rforge.net/JavaGD/ to be able to compile.
